# Weather Dashboard

# Version 1

# Description

In this project we used a server sided API to fetch data and parse selected data regarding the weather - With icons showcasing the weather - onto the page. This task involved the understanding of the API documentation and peacing together the pieces. I did get lost on occasion with the amount of brackets and if statements towards the end. I was able to put my head together and make sure the user has an amazing experience in viewing the weather dashboard.

# Tasks

When the user opens the weather dashboard with form inputs
They can search for a city
The user is presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history after searching in the search bar - input.
When the user views current weather conditions for that city
Then they are presented with the city name, the date, and an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
The UV index will present a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
When the user views the future weather conditions for that city
Then they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
When the user clicks on a city in the search history
Then they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
